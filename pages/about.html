        </br>Nobody cares if you can'tmdance well. Just get up and dance. Great dancers are great because of their </br>
           passion.Archaeological evidence for early dance includes 10,000-years-old paintings in Madhya Pradesh, </br>
           India at the Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka, and Egyptian tomb paintings depicting dancing figures, dated  </br>
           c.‚Äâ3300 BC. It has been proposed that before the invention of written languages, dance was an important </br>
           part of the oral and performance methods of passing stories down from one generation to the next.The  </br>
           use of dance in ecstatic trance states and healing rituals (as observed today in many contemporary indi- </br>
           genous cultures) is thought to have been another early factor in the social development of dance. </br></br>

           Great artists are people who find the way to be themselves in their art.Dance is integral to being human. </br>
           It‚Äôs an art form that has transcended cultures across millennia. But only dancers know what it means to </br>
           dedicate their lives to the craft. As Merce Cunningham explains in her quote below, dance does not </br>
           produce things like poems or paintings that can be hung on the wall. So, what drives the dancer to
           perfect </br>their art?</p></br>
